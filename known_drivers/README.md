# Nvidia drivers

A single nix expression listing known nvidia driver versions and their corresponding hashes.
To be used as input to flakes that use nixGL

The list of version/hash pairs can be regenerated by the `mk-nvidia-drivers.py` script,
which fetches the list of drivers at https://download.nvidia.com/XFree86/Linux-x86_64/
for each version, attempts to locate a runfile using the same url template as used to
generate the nixGLNvidia wrappers, then run nix-prefetch-url to get the hash, then
cleans the downloaded runfile out the store.
